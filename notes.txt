throw out month column

example given: clocked IN but not OUT 

In this assignment you will be given a (fictious) log from a card-key access system covering a period of two weeks. 
The log is a TAB Delimited file where each line records the employee number (20 employees), the day, the month, the hour and
minutes carded IN and the day, the month, and the hour and minutes carded OUT. 
All data is in integer format using a 24-hour clock. 
Employees are required to card IN and card OUT each day. 
Ignore the fact that they work seven days a week, this is not relevant. 

!! If a value for any time has not been recorded it
will be shown as 0.


(look for zeros)

ex. employee 3 on day 4 didn't clock out.
call this anomaly 1 (notClockedOut)

ex. employee 14 on day 3 didn't clock in
call this anomaly 2 (notClockedIn)
